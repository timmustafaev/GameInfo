# GameInfo

This Flutter project was developed as a part of my Dart/Flutter university course. It's a database that permits to consult the information of multiple videogames and add new ones to the database provided you have a moderator's account. The data was initially obtained from the RAWG.IO API and it is contained and updated in Google Firebase.  

The application has multiple widgets. Pantalla_inicial is the initial page where you log in. If you don't have an account then by tapping on the "register new account' a new user may be created in PantallaRegistro. PantallaLista is the widget that contains the list of videogames saved in Firebase and by tapping on any one of them transfers you to video_game_screen of a particular videogame. The app also permits to save the favourites which can be consulted in PantallaFavs. If you have a moderator's account, you can add new game to the Firebase in PantallaAnadirJuego.
